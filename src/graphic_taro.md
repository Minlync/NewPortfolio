    <p class="p40">Taro is a newborn sub-milk tea brand under bite-tea and located in Connecticut.
The target audience of Taro Taro is the young female group among the Asian group or non-Asian group in North America. They want a logo that can deliver their friendly brand spirit.
In the design, I used purple from the taro ingredient as a dominant color and draw an adorable taro image that holds a straw on the top of the cup. Personification is a common strategy also in the design field.
On the other hand, the taro also would treat as a cheese cream topping in the boba.</p>
