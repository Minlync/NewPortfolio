<h1>Piet Mondrian<h2>
<p>This project is inspired by Piet Mondrian. Piet Mondrian was a Dutch painter and art theoretician who is regarded as one of the greatest artists of the 20th century. The feature of his works is widely used red, yellow, and blue these three-primary colors.

I used the functions of random and for loop to create this interactive project. When the user clicks the screen the rectangles and colors will change randomly.</p>
