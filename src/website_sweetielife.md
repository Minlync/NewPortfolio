     <h1>MY ROLE</h1>
      <p>This is a school final project for class MMP350 (Advanced Website Design). The original intention of our team to create a sweetie life website aims to instruct pastry lovers on how to create delicate and delicious pastries from all over the world.
     In my role in this project, I was the coding manager and design manager. I was responsible for creating cohesive and visually attractive front-end designs including the website user interface, logo design, color scheme, responsive site, and CSS.
      I love how colors and font can completely transform a website into something beautiful and inspiring. Vivid imagery and a fresh layout can help our website to deliver our intention effectively. I love the process of debugging and testing. It helped me strengthen my coding skill.</p>
      <h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
      <p>The purpose of Sweetie Life is to instruct on how to create delicate and delicious pastries from all over the world. Regardless of where you are located, or what level your pastries-making skills are at, Sweetie Life provides a detailed description on all presented pastries on our website and easy to follow recipes. Additionally, Sweetie Life prepares high-quality, different baking level, online lesson services in order for students to interact with our instructor and get timely responses. </p>
      <h1>GOALS</h1>
      <p>To teach and guide all visitors that are on different pastry making levels by presenting them with a few pastries, their history, and a recipe they can follow for each treat. As well as introducing monthly and yearly packets the audience can buy if they are interested in more in depth lessons plus exclusive recipes.  </p>
