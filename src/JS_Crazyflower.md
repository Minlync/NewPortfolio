<h1>Game Development<h2>
<p>This is a Game Development project that i coded for NYU Code2! Class.</p>
<p>I used HTML, CSS, and JS to complete this Game. I used JavaScript and incorporated the “For loop function “and the “random function “to create these crazy flowers. 
In the [ flower.js ] page, I set two functions: one is 'move' and the other is 'show'. 
So, when the user presses the spacebar and hits the flower, it will trigger three functions: 'reduce', 'key press', and 'sound. play'. When the user hits the flower, the shaking flower's size will reduce based on the frequency of the user. Meanwhile, the console .log will indicates “hit " and shows user hit accurate position of the flower element.
The flowers from Japanese artist Takashi Murakami.</p>
