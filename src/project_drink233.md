    <h1>Who is Drink233</h1>
     <p> We started Drink233 as an alternative to artisanal coffee culture and the extreme, hyperbolic world of energy drinks. Our adventurous elixirs - made with ceremonial green tea - are a special sort of pick-me-up. A calm, clear, and centered energy guaranteed to elevate your day.</p>
     <p>We want to deliver not only high-quality tea powder products but also a brand new luxury daily brewing experience to our customers. In one minute, you can have a high-end caffeine or decaf tea drink with the flavor of your choice, at home. It’s simple, affordable, and fun.
     The three brand pillars we have are uplift, thrive, and protect. We want to send our customers energy whether they are working from home, still commuting to work, or just need a boost whenever they need; we want to help them feel optimistic and successful on whatever they are working on; but we don’t want them to get overwhelmed from taking in too much caffeine as we have very strict control on our ingredients."</p>
      <h1> My Role</h1>
       <p>I designed several geometrical shapes around the tea topic base on brand conception of the Drink 233 and their major product.
These elements indicate teapot, tealeaves, teacup, and tea mountain.
The target audience with Drink 233 is among the 18 to the 35-year-old female group. 
So, I choose to use different hues with green to deliver the visual experience of green, organic and natural with tea.</p>
