      <p style="color: #E77246; width=70% font-size: 16px;">My responsibilities included designing and communicating with clients to build, design, and test the websites including visual identity and functional flow.  
To meet the client's request that an energetic and vibrant brand spirit, I followed Vanessa's Dumpling House's brand dominant color orange but choose light yellow as a secondary color to develop and finalize the website color scheme and design the entire website's visual guidelines. Additionally, Vanessa's dumpling house is originally from Beijing flavor dumplings but gradually become a famous chain dumpling house in the New York metro area. So, to keep Chinese culture I also blend some Chinese characters in the Home page as decorations.</p>


<p style="color: #E77246; width=70%  font-size: 16px;">I contributed to and designed most pages such as the home, merchandise, location, about us, and both opportunities pages. It was a rewarding experience, and I am proud to have contributed to the creation of a visually appealing and user-friendly website for Vanessa's Dumpling House.</p>
